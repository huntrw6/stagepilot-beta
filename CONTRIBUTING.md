# Contributing to StagePilot

StagePilot is intended for live-production use, so clear failure behavior and
tests matter as much as the happy path. Small, reviewable changes are preferred.

## Set up a development environment

Install Python 3.12+, uv, a current Node.js LTS release, and npm. Rust stable and
the Tauri v2 system prerequisites are needed only for desktop work.

```sh
uv sync --project backend --extra dev
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../desktop
npm install
cd ..
```

Run the backend and frontend in separate terminals using the commands in
[README.md](README.md). Demo mode should remain usable without vendor accounts or
production equipment.

## Branches and commits

Create focused branches such as `feat/event-stream`, `fix/song-index-bounds`,
or `docs/plugin-lifecycle`. Use conventional commit messages where practical:

```text
feat(core): add asynchronous event bus
fix(api): reject zero-duration timer actions
test(midi): cover note-on velocity zero
docs: clarify LAN security boundary
```

Do not commit credentials, local configuration, generated dependency folders,
build outputs, or log files.

## Formatting, linting, and tests

Before opening a pull request, run the checks relevant to the changed workspace:

```sh
cd backend
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
cd ..

npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm --prefix frontend run typecheck
npm --prefix frontend run build

cargo fmt --manifest-path desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo check --manifest-path desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

Use `ruff format` or `cargo fmt` without `--check` to apply formatting. Frontend
formatting follows the scripts and configuration committed in that workspace.

Tests should describe observable behavior, including bounds, timeouts, malformed
input, reconnects, and failure isolation. Vendor API tests must use mocks and
must never require contributor credentials.

## Pull requests

A pull request should:

- explain the user-visible or architectural outcome;
- stay within one coherent concern;
- include or update tests for behavioral changes;
- update public documentation and the changelog when appropriate;
- identify unverified platform or vendor assumptions;
- pass backend, frontend, and desktop checks affected by the change; and
- avoid unrelated formatting or generated-file churn.

Reviewers may ask for reliability evidence beyond unit tests when a change can
affect a live cue, timer, credential, or network boundary.

## Contributing a plugin

Read [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) first. New plugins belong behind the core
plugin contract, publish and subscribe through typed events, expose health, and
must not import another integration plugin. Include deterministic tests with a
fake client or transport.

Propose event-model changes separately when possible. Event names and payloads
are shared contracts; an integration-specific payload should not be added to a
general domain event merely for one vendor.

## Security reports

Do not open a public issue containing credentials, tokens, private network
details, or an exploitable vulnerability. Until a dedicated private reporting
channel is published, remove all sensitive data from a minimal report and ask a
maintainer for a private contact path.
