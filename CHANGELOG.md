# Changelog

All notable changes to StagePilot will be documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
intends to use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once releases begin.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial monorepo foundation for the FastAPI backend, React dashboard, and
  Tauri desktop shell.
- Typed asynchronous event bus, observable application state, isolated plugin
  manager, structured logging, and graceful application lifecycle.
- Demo service workflow with safe song navigation, timer simulation, REST
  actions, health/state APIs, and full-state WebSocket updates.
- Dark, responsive live-production dashboard with connection status, ordered
  songs, current timer state, readiness checks, manual controls, and events.
- Core, plugin, API, and WebSocket tests plus backend and frontend quality
  tooling.
- Shared architecture, contribution, configuration, security, plugin, and
  milestone documentation.
- Safe example environment configuration and repository ignore rules.
- Secret-aware Planning Center PAT configuration with validated credentials,
  IANA time zone, request timeout, and identifying user-agent settings.
- Typed asynchronous Planning Center service-type client with Basic Auth,
  version pinning, safe pagination, timeout handling, sanitized errors, and
  mocked contract tests.
- Today-first Planning Center plan discovery with timezone-aware service-time
  matching and a configurable nearest-upcoming fallback window that defaults to
  30 days. Discovery excludes past and no-service-time plans and preserves
  explicit ambiguity when multiple plans share the selected date.
- Ordered linked and generic Planning Center song parsing with scheduled
  durations, source song IDs, and visible skipped-item reasons.
- Production Planning Center plugin startup and reload orchestration with
  current-or-upcoming last-known-good plans, connection and discovery state,
  explicit dashboard plan selection, skipped-item visibility, live health,
  single-flight refreshes, date-rollover cleanup, and demo-mode isolation.
- First backend MIDI Playback slice with disabled-by-default Mido/RtMidi input
  discovery, environment-configured port, channel, and six cue mappings, bounded
  ordered dispatch, duplicate protection, reconnect handling, safe port metadata,
  session-only API and dashboard input selection, disconnect and refresh
  controls, and manual cue simulation through the hardware action path.
- Bounded live MIDI note monitor with port, channel, note, velocity, and
  accepted-or-ignored diagnostics in the production dashboard.
- Vitest and React Testing Library coverage for dashboard plan ambiguity,
  pending selection, revision-safe live state, stale readiness, and skipped-item
  warnings.
